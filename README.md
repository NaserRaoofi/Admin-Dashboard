## Module Configuration

### EC2 Module
```hcl
module "ec2_monitoring" {
  source = "./modules/ec2"
  
  # Basic Configuration
  aws_region        = "us-east-1"
  monitoring_period = 300
  
  # Advanced Features
  enable_detailed_monitoring = true
  cpu_anomaly_band_width    = 2
  memory_threshold          = 80
  disk_io_threshold        = 100000000
  
  # Alert Configuration
  evaluation_periods     = 2
  alarm_actions_enabled = true
}
```

### Security Module
```hcl
module "security_monitoring" {
  source = "./modules/security"
  
  # Security Features
  enable_guardduty        = true
  enable_security_hub     = true
  enable_root_monitoring  = true
  
  # Alert Thresholds
  failed_login_threshold          = 3
  unauthorized_api_threshold      = 5
  security_group_change_threshold = 1
  
  # Log Management
  log_retention_days = 90
}
```

## Best Practices

### Monitoring Strategy
1. Start with baseline metrics
2. Enable detailed monitoring for critical resources
3. Implement custom metrics for application-specific monitoring
4. Use anomaly detection for dynamic thresholding
5. Configure appropriate retention periods for logs

### Security Implementation
1. Follow principle of least privilege
2. Enable MFA for all IAM users
3. Regularly rotate access keys
4. Monitor and alert on security events
5. Implement automated security responses

### Cost Optimization
1. Use resource tagging for cost allocation
2. Implement auto-scaling based on metrics
3. Regular review of unused resources
4. Monitor Reserved Instance coverage
5. Implement cost anomaly detection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. Missing CloudWatch permissions
2. Incorrect metric dimensions
3. Alert fatigue from too sensitive thresholds
4. Log retention cost management
5. Security Hub integration issues

### Resolution Steps
1. Verify IAM permissions
2. Check metric configurations
3. Adjust threshold values
4. Optimize log retention policies
5. Validate service integrations
